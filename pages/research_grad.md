The gradient group develops novel high-performance gradient insert designs that aim to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and image distortions of MR images by reducing the time needed for spatial and molecular motion encoding. In addition, we are developing ultrasonic (silent) gradients with the aim to improve patient comfort by enabling faster and quieter scanning. For the high-performance gradients, the main application areas are diffusion, flow, and functional MRI while the ultrasonic gradients focus on applications to clinical protocols and spectroscopy. 

Research in the gradient group not only focusses on gradient design but also on software development for novel MR-sequences and reconstruction methods to take full advantages of the spatial and molecular motion encoding capabilities of the MR-system.
